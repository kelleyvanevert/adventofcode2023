/// invoked when there are shared `&Heap` borrows. Therefore, when there are
/// shared `&Heap` borrows, you may freely use [`Gc<T>`][crate::Gc] instead of
/// [`Root<T>`][crate::Root] to hold references to objects in the heap without
/// fear of the GC collecting the objects out from under your feet. Traversing
/// deeply nested structures will have more overhead when using
/// [`Root<T>`][crate::Root] than when using [`Gc<T>`][crate::Gc] because
/// [`Root<T>`][crate::Root] must maintain its associated entry in the heap's
/// root set.
///
/// # Finalization and `Drop`
///
/// Unlike many GC libraries for Rust, it is perfectly safe and footgun-free to
/// put `Drop` types in the GC heap, even if they have references to other GC
/// objects. Finalization of and `Drop` implementations for GC objects is
/// usually tricky because of the risks of accessing objects that have already
/// been reclaimed by the collector or accidentally entrenching objects and
/// making them live again.
///
/// The reason this is fine with `safe-gc` is because the `Drop` implementation
/// doesn't have access to a `Heap`, so it statically *cannot* suffer from those
/// kinds of bugs.
///
/// # Cross-`Heap` GC References
///
/// Typically, GC objects will only reference other GC objects that are within
/// the same `Heap`. In fact, edges reported to the [`Collector`] *must* point
/// to objects within the same `Heap` as the object being traced or else
/// [`Collector::edge`] will raise a panic.
///
/// However, you can create cross-heap edges with [`Root<T>`][crate::Root], but
/// it requires some care. While a [`Root<T>`][crate::Root] pointing to an
/// object in the same `Heap` will make all transitively referenced objects
/// unreclaimable, a [`Root<T>`][crate::Root] pointing to an object in another
/// heap will not indefinitely leak memory, provided you do not create *cycles*
/// across `Heap`s. To fully collect all garbage across all `Heap`s, you will
/// need to run GC on each `Heap` either
///
/// * in topological order of cross-`Heap` edges, if you statically know that
///   order in your application, or
///
/// * in a fixed point loop, if you do not statically know that order.
///
/// However, if you don't statically know that topological order, it is
/// recommended that you don't create cross-`Heap` edges; you will likely
/// accidentally create cycles and leak memory. Instead, simply put everything
/// in the same `Heap`.
///
/// Collecting cycles across `Heap`s would require a global, cross-`Heap`
/// collector, and is not a goal of this crate. If you do choose to create
/// cross-`Heap` references, the responsibility of avoiding cross-`Heap` cycles
/// is yours.
